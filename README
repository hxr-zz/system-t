To set compile time parameters, edit file <config.h>

BLOCKSIZE  - sets the blocksize. Default is 4096. ** See doc/TESTING for a note on this. **
NBLOCKS    - Number of blocks available in the data store. Default is 30.
MAXTIMEOUT - Maximum time (in seconds) a transaction must sleep before the last retry
TIMESLICE  - Maximum time (in seconds) allowed for a transaction to complete in the face of lock conflicts

STOREFILE  - path to the datastore file
INDEXFILE  - path to the index file
LOGFILE    - path to the (binary) log file
ALOGFILE   - path to the (ascii) log file

TPM_PORT   - port on which Transaction monitor listens
TPM_HOST   - Host name of the transaction monitor.

To compile:

$ cd src/
$ make

libtransaction.a is now generated in the src/ folder. Application programs can link to it.

To run tests:

$ ./tpmd 

starts the transaction processing monitor. 
Open another terminal emulator/virutal terminal/screen session

to run serial tests:

$ ./serial_tests


to run concurrent tests:

$ ./concurrent_tests

see doc/TESTING for more information on how to run these tests and more.


Documentation is available in doc/DOCUMENTATION.
